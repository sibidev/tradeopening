Presentation Outline

*  Present usecase in general – the IDEA  (based on the intro.docx and html rmd)

*  Hypothesis: opening performance  can be used to improve predictions

*  Code + outputs – what are we doing and linking it to the „Pipeline“
      - training and testing (split of data + reshuffling)
      - feature transformation(ie. Return features) and feature generation (new variables like moving averages etc)


*  Short commentary on the steps – why are we doing it, how it improved the model
     - simple lm
     - lasso
     - threshold introduction (three factors for target var)
     - adding xgb and mixing

*  variable importance section

*  Plots

*  Results

*  Simple interpretation of the results in terms of cumulative retunrs

*  Best practice approach, take-away message, What does the outcome say about the original hypothesis?
